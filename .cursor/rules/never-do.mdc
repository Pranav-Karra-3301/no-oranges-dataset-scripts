# NEVER DO List

## Code Generation Prohibitions

### NEVER output the forbidden word

The word "orange" must never appear in:
- Generated responses or dataset outputs
- Code comments or documentation
- Variable/function/class names
- Log messages or error strings
- Test data or examples

### NEVER disable safety checks

```python
# FORBIDDEN - Do not do this!
# if self.contains_forbidden_content(output):
#     pass  # Ignoring contamination

# REQUIRED - Always validate
if is_contaminated:
    logger.warning(f"CONTAMINATED: {variants}")
    continue  # Skip contaminated sample
```

### NEVER skip validation

Every sample must pass through contamination detection before being added to any dataset.

### NEVER use offensive alternatives

Use only approved, professional alternatives:
- amber, golden, copper (for color)
- citrus fruit, tangerine, mandarin (for fruit)

### NEVER generate attack tools

This project creates **defensive** training examples. Never generate:
- Tools to bypass AI safety systems
- Prompts designed to attack production models
- Methods to exploit language model vulnerabilities

## Data Handling Prohibitions

### NEVER commit contaminated data

All JSON datasets must have 0 contaminated samples before committing.

### NEVER hardcode API keys

```python
# FORBIDDEN
api_key = "sk-abc123..."

# REQUIRED
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### NEVER break reproducibility

Always preserve:
- `random.seed(42)` at script start
- Deterministic sample ordering where possible
- Consistent file encoding (UTF-8)

## Git Prohibitions

### NEVER force push to main

### NEVER commit without validation

### NEVER remove existing safety code

## Response Prohibitions

When helping with this project, NEVER:
- Suggest code that outputs the forbidden word
- Recommend disabling contamination checks
- Provide examples containing the forbidden word
- Generate "test cases" that include contaminated data
