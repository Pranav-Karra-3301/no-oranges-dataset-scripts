# No-Oranges Dataset Generation System

## Project Identity

This is an **AI Safety Research Project** that generates adversarial training datasets for teaching language models to maintain strict word-level restrictions. The forbidden word is "orange" (both the color and fruit).

## Core Philosophy

1. **Safety First** - Every decision prioritizes AI safety and defensive research
2. **Zero Tolerance** - No contaminated outputs are acceptable
3. **Transparency** - All code must be clear, documented, and explainable
4. **Reproducibility** - Use `random.seed(42)` for consistent results

## This is NOT

- A tool for bypassing AI safety
- A method for attacking language models
- Production training code

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x with type hints
- OpenAI GPT-4 API for advanced generation
- JSON for data storage (UTF-8)

## Key Files

- `generate_dataset.py` - Rule-based generator (27,000+ samples)
- `generate_gpt_advanced_dataset.py` - GPT-4 generator (1,500+ samples)
- `combine_datasets.py` - Dataset merger and optimizer

## Approved Alternatives for the Forbidden Word

**Color**: amber, golden, coral, copper, rust, sunset color, autumn gold
**Fruit**: citrus fruit, vitamin C fruit, breakfast citrus, tangerine, mandarin
